## 🏗️ System Architecture

- Grok 4.3+ with video generation access
- For the `.grok/skills/` version (Grok Build TUI): the agents directly invoke `image_gen` / `image_edit` + `image_to_video` / `reference_to_video` + `run_terminal_command` (ffmpeg) to output real playable video files and stitched final films in the workspace. Follows the built-in `imagine` skill video protocol (keyframe staging, end-frame continuity, simple per-shot motion). Supports strong language locking for consistent audio (e.g. pure Korean).
- Basic understanding of prompt engineering (helpful but not required)

Remote structure (v3.5+):
```
Studio Director v3.5
├── references/agents/          # Authoritative 22 Role Cards (recommended)
├── tools/cinematic_studio_cli.py   # Full-featured CLI + Memory + PDF reports
├── web_ui/app.py                 # Streamlit frontend with Memory management
├── examples/                     # Production Bible templates
├── MASTER_PROMPT_v3.5.md         # Main activation prompt
└── .grok/skills/                 # Custom Grok skills
```

**Key Components:**
- `references/agents/` — **Single source of truth** for all 22 Role Cards
- `tools/cinematic_studio_cli.py` — CLI with memory, bible generation, and reporting
- `web_ui/app.py` — Modern web interface with live simulation and Memory section
- `examples/` — Diverse, high-quality Production Bible templates
